	<h2>Rules</h2>
	<p class="rules-content">
	  Bid whist is a partnership trick-taking card game. It is played with a standard 52 card deck plus 2 jokers, one big and one little. There are 4 players, 2 per team, each sitting opposite their partner. Each team starts with a score of zero, with the object of reaching a score of 7 or more points, or forcing the other team to go negative 7 or more points. Points are scored by bidding for and winning tricks, or books.
	</p>
	<h3>The Deal</h3>
	<p class="rules-content">
	  The first dealer may be chosen at random. With a shuffled deck, cards are dealt one at a time in clockwise order, starting with the player to the dealer's left. During the deal, six cards are to be placed face down in the middle to form a kitty. Once all cards have been dealt, each player has 12 cards. After each hand, turn to deal passes to the left.
	</p>
	<h3>The Bidding</h3>
	<p class="rules-content">
	  There is only one round of bidding, starting with the player to the dealer's left. Each bid consists of a number from 3 to 7 and a suffix "high", "low", or "no trump". The number indicates the number of books <strong>plus 6</strong> that the bidder's team commits to win. "High" means higher cards will win, and the bidder will declare a trump suit. "Low" means lower cards will win, and the bidder will declare a trump suit. "No trump" means there will be no trump, and the bidder will declare the direction of precedence (high or low). Each player in turn must either pass or name a bid higher than the previous one. A bid is higher if the number is higher. If the number is the same, "no trump" beats "low", which beats "high".
	</p>
	<h3>The Play</h3>
	<p class="rules-content">
	  The highest bidder names the trump suit, or for a no trump bid, high or low play. The player takes the 6 cards from the kitty, and puts down 6 cards from their combined hand. The cards from the kitty are first displayed to the other players if a trump suit is named. The 6 discarded cards form the first book for the player's team. The player leads, playing a card from his/her hand, and the other players play a card in turn clockwise, the 4 cards forming a book. Players must follow the suit of the lead card, if possible. If a player does not have a card of the lead suit, they may play any card. Trump cards beat non-trump cards in a book. If multiple trump cards are played, the trump with highest precedence based on the bid wins. If no trumps are played, the highest card of the lead suit wins the book. The winner of the book leads the next. The jokers are the best cards of the trump suit in both high and low bids. If the bid is no trump, all suits are non-trump suits, and jokers are worthless (cannot win a book).
	</p>
	<h3>Scoring</h3>
	<p class="rules-content">
	  Each team starts with a score of zero. At the end of each hand, the bidding team either wins or loses points, depending on if they make their bid. The game ends when a team wins by reaching a cumulative score of seven or more, or loses by reaching a cumulative score of negative seven or worse.
	</p>
	<p class="rules-content">
	  At the end of each hand, the books won by the bidding team are counted. If the number of books is at least six plus their bid, the team makes the bid, and receives one point for each book past six. If they do not make their bid, the team loses points equal to their bid number. If it is a no trump bid, the scoring for the hand is doubled.
